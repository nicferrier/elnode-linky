A very small link app for exposing links.

This is intended to be a solution for the problem of getting at links
you're developing locally but that you need to see on your mobile.

Simply register, then use the form or the url to POST your link to the
site.

Then visit the site on the mobile and you'll be able to see the link.

Of course, you must both be on the same LAN for this to work.
